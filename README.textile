h1. Quote Crate

*A place to store and organize quotations.* Or it will be. The goal is to create
a RESTful API for saving and searching quotes on the web. Currently it is pretty
primitive as you can only save them, but they are being properly indexed as of
"v2":v2 which proved to be far more of a challenge than I expected.

h2. Implementation

In my opinion the cool thing about this is the somewhat low-level implementation
of Lucene I created to write information into Google's Datastore. The code for
this currently sits in the quotidian.search package though I would like to split
it into it's own project.

h2. Inspiration

This stemmed from of Alex Payne's "Open Ideas" or "Unfinished Ideas" which he
termed "Quotidian":quotidian. When I read his quick post about it I was struck
and went to work on it almost immediately figuring I could have a working version
up on the (at the time) newly released Google App Engine for Java pretty quickly.
Man was I wrong. A key component of this application is the ability to search
for stored quotes which is something that proved difficult with the immediately
available tools.
